this way
it says stop and go
for the cars that are waiting to cross the track maybe

oh that's not an accident
how does an airplane come down
does it come straight down

why does he do that
drive
because it doesn't have a motor
i don't really know where a motor is on an airplane
why don't you ask ursula
perhaps she knows
this is the landing wheel
after you get up in the air it fold back
because it has a motor and it has a pilot to drive it

no the wheel
what
it turns when it's getting ready to go up in the sky
why did you take my racers
this is green
green like the green light
what does this mean
how could an airplane go through a tunnel
how could it
i don't think it could go under it easily or through it
what should we say adam
do we go under a tunnel or do we go through a tunnel
adam if we put this here and we all start racing who wins the
how does your car win
alright let's try
and who's the winner
yours what
what happens when he has a flat tire
can he keep on driving or does he have to stop
he can
with a flat tire
adam did you tell her about your accident
what happened

how did you catch
yes last year
but what happened to your toe
no it got caught in what
his tricycle
it wasn't
we had to use the pliers
no you couldn't
well we can play a guessing game
alright
let's play it
i don't think that's a car
what do you think it is not
you don't think that's a truck
well i don't think that's a bow
no
i think it might be something that flies in the air
i don't think it's an airplane
a spear
no i don't think it's a spear either
what else can fly in the air
a bird
it doesn't have any wings
maybe
you have to do something to it first
i think perhaps you'll have to put it together in some way
first you have to find out what it is
you might not like it
let's think a little while
you don't know
i still think something that flies in the air and maybe you
i think so
you mean unwrap
she might have that for robin
don't you think robin needs a kite
put it down
you play with something else a minute while i get paul up
so the short wouldn't come out
what's a short
what
hi paul
hi sleepy head
oh you're not a sleepy head now
there isn't much wind at all
perhaps tomorrow
no that's a string for what
watch the little cars
you can't
oh you can
let's see if you can
he has a flat tire
oh he didn't have a flat tire
what happens when you win
probably
careful adam

why do you think it sticks
oh it's glue
is that why it's sticking
it's not a magnet after all
it's not
it's not coming out
i don't think it really needs water
it probably needs a little more ink in the pan
no no this probably needs some more ink
pen ink
stamp ink
that's not really ink
that's the water that's mixed in with ink
no i don't think you need water dear
on the pad yes

why don't you do it over here
hit on the black
almost
two more darts

let's look at your gun
careful adam
alright
why don't you stick to one thing
only the one thing yes
that's right
she wants so much toys

stand up
what're you supposed to be
do you have one diandra
just like a target shall be
is that what you said
you're aiming some place
a mexican day
yes he can keep it
that's right
what's wrong paul
why

a gun
i don't feel like reaching way up there
am i that tall
am i that tall
uhhuh

are you going to be tall enough
promise not to do it again
i still can't reach it
i'm afraid that won't be sufficient
did it
good
it's not up there by glue
she said no just like i said no
no
it works like a plunger
no it's not a magnet
why do you think it sticks
that's not the reason
see if you can find out why
it's not glue
i surely don't
yes just like a plunger that's right
when you push down it pushes out the air underneath there
can you tell me what makes that stick
i don't talk to you like that
it wouldn't stick would it
why
the what
the dodge
what is the dodge
just a minute ago you were saying it was some other kind of a gun
i don't know that i've heard of anybody with rodger as a last name
you didn't hit her
are you sure
what
that's his nursery school teacher
how many do you have
get on the other side honey
you get on this side diandra
close the door diandra
a mule
that's what the expression is
it's something you say to
yes you say it to a person to help explain something or add
you could shoot at anything that's set up for a target
oh is that why you missed
you say no
why not
why not
i'm going upstairs and check on paul

david is eleven now
no
i think so
whatever you'd like to play
old mac donald
he says he'd sharpen scissors and knives and gives you a year's
for the sound
maybe the hole is for the sound to come out
do you think you're finished with the banjo
you don't like those
now let's make a little ball and hide it inside here
did you tell ursula what you do at school
oh that's delicious
it will come off
you can wash it off
very pretty
oh no thank you
i'll just enjoy yours
shall we make something with these
did you tell her our telephone number adam

you have to give him some nice strong legs to stand on
with a clock on it
oh no
can you blow
if she said yes it must be yes
hold it up so adam can see how it looks
look at it
you can make it
oh you know you can try

okay don't play with it adam
you may break it
well maybe when you get a little bigger
david's eleven years old

that's how to add
this is add a scale
no no that's not time see
get all your numbers then you add add two
yeah
two and one are
three
see how it goes
see you got ta have ones
alright but what makes four
oh she has seven
you have to find out what what would make seven
see
see how it goes down
you have to get it so that it'll stay on top
you got a two and a one over here
see you have to put five
see there
that's five
yeah put the two up first
two and five
that add up to seven
see look
whoop five fell off
see
see five and two are seven
oh well if you wanna put that one on first
here
yeah
i'll call grampy
oh
you can put it on the other side
yeah
so so what does that mean if it balances
hey you got that clay all over ya
she got a clay set
it's got
they were playing with it last night
she got it all over her
you should have seen her face
that means what
it means three and three are six
