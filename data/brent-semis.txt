what a
what about this one
this is a long book
long ago in a faraway land
lived a poor orphan named aladin
one day in the market aladin took some bread
the sultan's guard chased him but aladin and his pet monkey abu
then aladin saw two hungry children and gave the bread to them
things will change
he told abu
someday
we'll live in a palace
that afternoon the sultan told princess jasmine she was to marry a
i will marry only for love
she cried
jasmine disguised herself and ran away
in the market she took an apple
but couldn't pay the angry
aladin rescued her
the merchant called the guard
they released the princess
but took aladin to the palace
meanwhile jafar
the sultans's evil counselor
disguised himself
help me find a very special lamp
he said to aladin
and i'll set you free
god bless you
jafar took aladin and abu to the cave_of_wonders
touch nothing but the lamp
he said
a magic carpet appeared and led aladin to the lamp
aladin reached for it
abu grabbed a ruby
the cave began to collapse
the magic carpet saved aladin and abu
but all three were trapped
what's so special about this old lamp
aladin wondered aloud
as aladin rubbed the dust off an enormous genie appeared
master he said
i can grant you three wishes
now let's get out of here
aladin's first wish was to become a prince
so jasmine would marry him
he promised to use his third wish to set the genie free
later that day aladin arrived at the palace in grand style
i'm prince ali
he told
the sultan
that evening prince ali took jasmine for a ride on his wonderful
soon she became suspicious
aren't you the boy from the market
she asked
no i really am prince ali
he said
then the magic carpet took them back to the palace
that was wonderful
she said
sighed jasmine
she had fallen in love
things are finally going right
aladin happily told abu
but again jafar had ordered the guards to get rid of aladin
after the guards tossed aladin into the sea
he summoned the genie and used his second wish to save his own life
aladin returned to the palace with the lamp
but iago
jafar's parrot
stole it
so jafar became the genie's master
make me sultan
jafar commanded
make jasmine and her father my slave
the genie was forced to obey
jafar used his second wish to become a powerful sorcerer
changed aladin back into a beggar and sent him far away
the magic carpet
helped aladin return to the palace
jafar was furious that aladin found a way to trick him
the genie still has more power than you'll ever have
he said
it worked
jafar used his third wish to become a genie
but he forgot one thing
every genie must live in a lamp and so jafar disappeared
the sultan decided to let jasmine choose her own husband
i choose you
she told aladin
aladin's dream had come true
but he didn't forget his third wish
he said
genie
you're free forever
the end

pooh's neighborhood
let's see
i say
it's a splendid day in the neighborhood
said owl
it's a nice day here too
said winnie_the_pooh
exactly what i'm saying
said owl
a perfectly splendid day in the neighborhood
which neighborhood
are we talking about
asked pooh
neighborhood
said owl
our neighborhood
the place where we live and our neighbors live and are neighborly
oh
said pooh
it is a splendid day xxx
isn't it
quite
said owl
now i'm off for an owl's eye view
he flew up and circled once around pooh's house
what does it look like from up there
called pooh
i can see the hundred_acre_woods spread out below me
said owl
and it's a fine place indeed
as owl flew off
pooh began to think about what it means to live in a neighborhood
he thought perhaps he would take a neighborly present to his
he took a honey pot out of his cupboard and tied a nice blue
then he tucked it comfortably under his arm
and stomped down
house
but when he reached his thoughtful spot
which is halfway between his house and piglet's
pooh suddenly had a thought
i
could take this path straight to piglet's house
or
i could go up the path and around the whole neighborhood
and sooner or later the path would take me to piglet's house
and that is what he did
after he had walked for a time
he came to the house where kanga and roo lived
hello
kanga
said pooh
i'm just on my way to deliver this neighborly present to
but
pooh dear
piglet lives that way
said kanga pointing down the very path by which pooh had come
yes said pooh
but today i'm going the long way
oh i see
said kanga
in that case
perhaps you should join us for a snack
come on
pooh
cried roo
we're going to the picnic spot
pooh said he was feeling a bit eleven o'clock
so they all went together past the sandy pit where roo plays
up to the picnic spot to share a little something
half an hour and one picnic basket later
pooh thanked kanga
tucked piglet's honey pot back under his arm
and stomped down the path towards rabbit's house
um

if the bees were bears
you shouldn't have to climb up all these stairs

a splendid velveteen rabbit
in the nursery the toy trains both said that they were real
what is real
wondered the rabbit
when a child loves you for so long that you become worn and
said the skin horse
then you become real
how the rabbit longed to become real
i see your little nose
one night the boy took the rabbit to bed with him
and hugged him very tightly
he hugged him very tightly like this
just like i'm hugging you
from that day on
rabbit and boy went everywhere together
during a picnic the rabbit saw real live wild rabbits hoping
oh how he wished he were real
real
can you say real

well
that's something
the boy became ill one day
he had to stay in bed and could not play
but the rabbit stayed with him
when the boy became well again
the doctor sent him to the seashore
and ordered everything in his room
disinfected and all the toys burned
well how do you

she packed them each a lunch
kissed them
on the cheek
and sent them into the world
to seek their fortune
off they went together
each with a bright kerchief
for a knapsack
when they came to a fork in the road they bid each other goodbye
and good luck
then one went this way one went that way and one the other
soon the first little pig
met a man
carrying a great bundle of straw

he asked
could you spare enough straw for me to build myself a house
the man did as he was asked
