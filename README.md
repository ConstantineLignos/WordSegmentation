# Word Segmentation

This repository contains code for the experiments in a chapter of my
2013 dissertation [Modeling Words in the
Mind](https://lignos.org/thesis), as well as the papers [Infant Word
Segmentation: An Incremental, Integrated
Model](http://www.lingref.com/cpp/wccfl/30/paper2821.pdf) and
[Modeling Infant Word Segmentation](https://aclanthology.org/W11-0304).

Unfortunately, I never had a chance to publish a journal article that
includes the thesis chapter experiments, which are significantly more
refined than what is presented in the two papers.

If you would like a copy of the thesis chapter, please contact me at
lignos at brandeis dot edu.
