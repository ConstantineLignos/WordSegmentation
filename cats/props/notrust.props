#You must leave all parameters defined when editing this file. Leaving any parameters undefined may result in undefined behavior.
#Segmenter: Which segmenter to use.
#Stress_sensitive_lookup: Whether lexicon entries are stress-sensitive. Should be false unless you are changing the lookup functionality.
#Use_trust: Whether the segmenter is allowed to specify which boundaries are to be trusted when adding words to the lexicon.
#Drop_stress: Whether adjacent stresses in the input should be reduced to better reflect natural speech patterns.
#Use_stress: Whether the segmenter is given stress information.
#Use_prob_mem: Whether recall of words from the lexicon is proabilistic.
#Prob_mem_amount: Parameter for exponential function for probabilitic lexicon recall.
#Decay_amount: Amount lexical entries decay after each utterance. Experimental feature. Set to 0.0 to disable decay.
#Lex_normalization: Whether to normalize scores in the lexicon.
#Longest: Whether a subtractive segmenter is forced to use the longest words possible in its segmentation.
#Beam_size: Size of the beam for the beam segmenter. Set to 1 to use greedy search.
#Random_Seg_Rate: Rate at which the random segmenter places a boundary.
#Use_randomization: Whether to randomize word subtraction and hypothesis selection.
#Use_subseqdiscount: Whether to divide words scores by subsequence frequency.
#Lex_trace: Whether to print debugging information for lexicon stores and lookups
#Seg_trace: Whether to print debugging information for segmentation.
#Seg_logging: Whether to write out information about the evaluation of segmentation to a file.
#Lex_logging: Whether to write out information about the evaluation of the lexicon to a file.
